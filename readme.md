# nvfcfg

This repo contains my Neovim configuration. It is configured with Nix using
[NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf).

You can try it out temporarily without creating any permanent bloat files on
your system with

```bash
nix run github:thecolorman/nvfcfg#qwerty # omit the #qwerty part if you use colemak!
```
